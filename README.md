**Memory Game** is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program.

Submitted by: **Sandesh**

Time spent: **1** hours spent in total

Link to project: (https://ubiquitous-shared-philodendron.glitch.me)

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

- [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
- [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked.
- [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked.
- [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
- [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess.
- [x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
- [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
- [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
- [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
- [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
- [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
- [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
- [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
- [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
- [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions

1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.
   
  I used javascript.info and w3schools.com to help me complete my submission.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words)
   
   There were many challenges that I encountered while building the game and I loved working through those challenges. I really struggled with the playClueSequence function. I forgot to set the timeout which really made the program buggy and I didn't know at the time what was happening. But later, I realized that I had to use the setTimeOut function to listen for answers from the user. Another challenge that I encountered was the main game logic itself. I was struggling to establish a series of events that I want to check for the game logic. I also made a mistake by incrementing guessCounter inside the codeblock where we check if the guessCounter is equal to progress. I realized the mistake immediately and fixed the nested if conditions to facilitate proper game logic. The next challenge was the concept of Javascript DOM itself, especially the gameButtonArea div. I was really struggling to understand onclick, onmousedown and onmouseup events and how you would actually implement it in a button. So I visited w3schools and started reading more about the DOM, its functions and about triggering events using DOM. And I was finally able to trigger guess, startTone and stopTone functions easily after that. 
   

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words)
   
   My interest in web development has further strengthened after I finished my submission. But I do have a lot of queries about web development in general. Playing around with javascript DOM was a lot of fun and I want to know to what extent we can push javascript DOM usage to do some awesome new things. I also do have some questions about the security part of DOM. As javascript DOM lets us tinker with the html of a page, I want to know how secure that really is. Iâ€™ve heard about html injection attacks and want to know if the DOM is secure enough to do some heavy tasks involving the backend. I have been interested in the field of Web Development for some time now and I want to know if a beginner should choose a part of web development at first like frontend or backend and start learning technologies related to those or learn both backend and frontend first and then choose a specific field that you like more. 


4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words)
  
   The process of building this game was really informative and I had lots of fun doing it. But if I had a few hours more to work with the project, I would add a few features into the game. First of all, I would love to make the game have dynamic scores instead of a win or lose situation. This would really help retain amateur players that try the game for the first time. I would add one more page to the application where users can register and login. I would use HTML forms to direct the user from login to the main game where we retrieve the username from the url itself, store it in a json file and retrieve it later to store user scores. I would also add the options of leaderboards where I would list the top 5 players with the highest score in the game. This will help make the game more competitive and fun.
